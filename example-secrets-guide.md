# Login Test Guide with Secrets

This guide demonstrates secure login using the secrets management system.

The sensitive credentials are stored in `secrets.json` and referenced using placeholder syntax:
- `{{secret.ADMIN_USERNAME}}` - resolves to the admin username
- `{{secret.ADMIN_PASSWORD}}` - resolves to the admin password

Both fields are automatically marked as `sensitive: true` which means:
- Screenshots will blur/mask the input values
- Values are never sent to AI models in prompts
- Only resolved at execution time
